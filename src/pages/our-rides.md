Velo Club York run a variety of rides through the week and at weekends, from chaingangs to club runs to all-day epics.



Whichever ride you're on, you are expected to be equipped and prepared to take care of yourself in the event of a puncture or minor mechanical.



Anybody's welcome to come an join our rides without being a member, but if you'd like to join us, drop us a line.
