Velo Club York run a variety of rides through the week and at weekends, from chaingangs to club runs to all-day epics.

Whichever ride you're on, you are expected to be equipped and prepared to take care of yourself in the event of a puncture or minor mechanical.

Anybody's welcome to come an join our rides without being a member, but if you'd like to join us, drop us a line.


## Tuesday & Thursday (BST): Chaingang

Through the Summer months (starting when the clocks go forward and ending when they go back) VC York run a popular chaingang training ride. This is a close, fast group ride that will not only boost your strength and speed but your road craft too. 

Depending on numbers present we generally split the group into two or three bunches, the fastest of which go off first. Regardless of which group you ride in though, rest assured that this will be a training ride. The focus is on a smooth, fast and efficient ride where everyone gets the training they need.

Average speeds range between 19-23mph over a couple of hours depending on the group.

Both Tuesday and Thursday rides depart at 6pm from B&Q's delivery entrance on Osbaldwick Link Road.

### Tuesday's Route 

Tuesday's route takes in Sheriff Hutton and Easingwold over slightly rolling terrain, and returns to York via Benningborough Hall and Tollerton.

### Weekend club rides

Saturday morning rides start from the bus shelter opposite Joseph Rowntree Theatre on Haxby Road at 9am. Routes are generally decided on the day depending on the mood and requirements of those in attendance, and the weather.

All are welcome and whilst the pace can be fast, there will be regroups after climbs. That said, if there are repeated long waits for slower riders, we will part ways, so be prepared for getting yourself home.
