Velo Club York run a variety of rides through the week and at weekends, from chaingangs to club runs and weekend epics.

Whichever ride you're on, you are expected to be equipped and prepared to take care of yourself in the event of a puncture or mechanical.

Anybody is welcome to come an join our rides without being a member, but if you'd like to join us, [drop us a line](mailto:info@veloclubyork.co.uk).

## Saturday Club Run

Start your weekend off with a social training ride. Usually hilly, expect around 120km in the company of experienced racing cyclists. Average speed can depend on the route, conditions and whoâ€™s in the group on any given Saturday, but is generally around 27-30kph.

Rides run all year round and start at 9am from the bus shelter outside Nestle on Haxby Road (opposite Joseph Rowntree Theatre).

Weekend routes are generally decided on the day at the start of the ride depending on the mood and requirements of those in attendance.

The rides tend to be fast and tailored towards improving race fitness. However, Winter rides are more steady (more suited to newcomers) and Summer rides are faster as riders prepare for races.

## Chaingang

Through the Summer months (starting when the clocks go forward and ending when they go back) VC York run a popular chaingang training ride. This is a close, fast group ride that will not only boost your strength and speed but your road craft too. 

Depending on numbers present we generally split the group into two or three bunches, the fastest of which go off first. Regardless of which group you ride in though, rest assured that this will be a training ride. The focus is on a smooth, fast and efficient ride where everyone gets the training they need.

Average speeds range between 19-23mph over a couple of hours depending on the group.

Both Tuesday and Thursday rides depart at 6pm from B&Q's delivery entrance on Osbaldwick Link Road.

### Tuesday

Tuesday's route takes in Sheriff Hutton and Easingwold over slightly rolling terrain, and returns to York via Benningborough Hall and Tollerton.

### Thursday

Thursday's pan-flat route goes East through Holtby, Buttercrambe, Full Sutton, Fangfoss, Pocklington, then back via Allerthorpe, Melbourne, Sutton upon Derwent and Elvington.
