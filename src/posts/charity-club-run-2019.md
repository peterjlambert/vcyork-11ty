After the success of last year’s charity club run for Yorkshire Air Ambulance (raising £240!), we’ll be running another special club run on the same great route on Saturday 24th November, again in aid of Yorkshire Air Ambulance; a charity that hopefully we’ll never need to make use of, but would all like to be well funded if ever we do.

Here’s the link to the JustGiving page to make your donation. Please share it around on social media too.

This will be a Winter club ride (mudguards, please), on the same Wolds Reliability route that we’ve used for the last few years. It’s a great route and is relatively light on traffic. We’ll be keeping a steady pace to make this as accessible to as many as possible, with a cafe stop around half way.

The ride will leave from the shelter on Haxby Rd at 9am.

Here’s the route on Strava from last year’s ride: <https://www.strava.com/activities/1250432116>

Please come along and join us on the ride. Members and non-members welcome. Let’s just try and raise as much as we can for charity and have a good day out too.

Donations will be collected in person on the day but are preferred to be made online to this page to cut down on admin for me.

Dig deep and support the cause, and have a great ride.
