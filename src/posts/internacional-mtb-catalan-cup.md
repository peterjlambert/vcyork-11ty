VC York’s Chris Clark is back in racing action this weekend in Banyoles, near Girona for the Internacional MTB Catalan Cup.

I’m hoping to stay on top of VC York’s members’ fixtures and results this season and report more on here. If you have any upcoming races or events, please drop me an email at info@veloclubyork.co.uk.
