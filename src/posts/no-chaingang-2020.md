Next Tuesday, the first Tuesday after the clocks have gone forwards, would normally be the start of the chaingang season. 

## DO NOT GO TO CHAINGANG.

It is vitally important during this time that in order to prevent the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and to protect vital NHS services and frontline staff, that we do not group ride.

STAY AT HOME. Get on the turbo trainer or the rollers. DO NOT risk riding in a group. Riding, especially in a group, puts you at risk of either transmission of the virus or otherwise, injury. Neither of these is good at the best of times, but right now, our NHS is under incredible load. DO NOT risk putting the NHS under further load.

One last time: STAY AT HOME. There is no chaingang this season. There are no club rides.

Thanks for being great. Stay well and stay at home.
