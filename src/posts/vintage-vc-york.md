Whilst I'm a relative newcomer to VC York, I'm reminded occasionally of its heritage and the fact that its history spans decades. I've recently had emails from Judith Glover and also from Kevin Douglas' daughter, Stacey, passing on some race photos from a vintage period in VC York's history.

Many thanks to Judith and Stacey for sending these. If anyone else has VC York photography and memories they'd like to share, please get in touch at \[info@veloclubyork.co.uk](mailto:info@veloclubyork.co.uk).
